You aren't going to share anything novel or nonpublic
===
If an idea has any merit, someone is already working on it. Only very rarely is anything provided under an NDA actually nonpublic. Your competitors have probably considered your idea and are either working on it or have discarded it.

If I can copy your idea from what you're going to share it's probably not a very good idea
===

If your idea is that proprietary, get a patent or a copyright, not an NDA

Legal agreements are serious documents that take time to review and to consider throughout the duration of their effective dates
===
Signing a legal agreement is not something to do without thinking or reading; it's a binding contract that should be taken seriously. 

NDAs are (probably) impossible to enforce

The time you're spending creating and enforcing NDAs is a sign of misaligned priorities
===
If you aren't 100% focused on your customer at the startup stage there is something wrong. 

You aren't providing anything in return
===
Signing an NDA provides a value to a company that should be compensated. If the NDA isn't worth paying for the developer to sign, it's probably not worth signing. 

You can share non-public information and withhold the juicy details
===
There maybe something truly secret that you don't want to share. By sharing other details first without an NDA, the prospective employee can determine whether the job is actually a good fit before signing a legal agreement. 

Your NDA is one-sided
===
A one-sided NDA is a nonstarter. An employer should agree to use the same care in protecting confidential information shared with them as they expect from the employee. Furthermore, providing a one-sided NDA is an indicator of either inexperience or over-lawyering.

Lawyers are too expensive
===
There are a lot of better ways to spend money than having lawyers review nondisclosure agreements.

Developers don't need to sign NDA's to get a job
===
Developing for startups is in high demand. Good developers can find plenty of work at less litigious companies.

Objections and counterpoints
